# DiscreteAE3

1. Ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed:\
a. Python 3\
b. itertools\
c. pygame\
d. from bisect import bisect
e. pickle\
f. random\
g. from collections import Counter

2. To run without GUI for a more comprehensive output, run *‘test.py’*\
a. Probabilities, hands, and table will be outputted to the terminal\
b. To run more than one game back-to-back (more efficient than re-running the file), simply change the number in the loop at the end of the script.

3. Run *‘game.py’* to show the game with GUI\
a. Press any key to advance to the next stage of the game\
b. Probabilities of winning will be displayed adjacent to their respective hand\
c. To change the number of players, change the variable ‘numPlayers’ at the top of the game.py file\
d. SUGGESTION: test with fewer players for much faster runtime\
e. To run more than one game back-to-back, simply change the number in the loop at the end of the script.
